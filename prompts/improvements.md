# Seova Website Improvement Plan

This document outlines necessary additions and refinements to the Services section and mandatory legal footnotes, reinforcing the "Data-Driven Virtual Assistant" value proposition.

1. Service Section: Expansion and Refinement

    1.1. [ ] Create New Service Card (Implementation Focus)
     - Goal: Explicitly highlight the hands-on "Virtual Assistant" work.
     - Card Title: On-Page SEO Implementation
     - Card Description: We move beyond strategy to implement Title Tags, Meta Descriptions, H-tag structuring, and internal linking for immediate performance gains.
     - Suggested Icon: A document or page icon with a pen/checkmark (or similar SVG to denote editing/writing).

    1.2. [ ] Refine "Site Health Audits" Description
     - Goal: Emphasize that the audit leads directly to implementation/action.
     - Update Existing Description To: Technical diagnostics to keep your website fast, secure, and optimized. We then provide a clear action plan for technical implementation.
     - Note: This change is subtle but reinforces the value of having a technical VA.

2. Legal & Contact Footnotes

    These elements are critical for user trust and form compliance. They must be present and linked from the footer/forms.

    2.1. [ ] Implement Privacy Policy Link
     - Requirement: Ensure the #privacy link in the contact form links to a full, dedicated Privacy Policy page.
     - Content Brief: Must clearly detail data handling for the contact form, free tools, and any analytics used (e.g., Google Analytics 4).

    2.2. [ ] Implement Terms of Service (ToS) Link
     - Requirement: Add a link to a Terms of Service page in the footer/legal section.
     - Content Brief: Must outline user rules, especially regarding the free tools, and liability disclaimers for both free and paid services.

    2.3. [ ] Confirm Business Contact Visibility
     - Requirement: Ensure an explicit, non-form contact method is available, preferably in the footer.

    Action: Verify the business email address (hello@seova.pro or equivalent) is listed and clickable (Extract from environment variables).
